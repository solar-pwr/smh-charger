Custom firmware for EASUN ISolar-SMH-II-7K solar inverter charger

**For educational/experimental use only**
**This is very far from any "production" release,**
**but at this point seems to work fine for me**

Only AC charging supported. I've been developing and using this since 09/2025 as a high-efficiency PFC charger in my dual-conversion solar setup.
